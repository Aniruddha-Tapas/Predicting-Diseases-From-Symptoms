# Predicting-Diseases-From-Symptoms

This is an attempt to predict diseases from the given symptoms. A decision tree was trained on two datasets one scraped data from [here](http://people.dbmi.columbia.edu/~friedma/Projects/DiseaseSymptomKB/index.html).

This dataset was uncleaned so preprocessing is done and then model is trained and tested on it.

Next another decision tree was also trained on Manually created dataset which contains both training and testing sets. This data is cleaned and extensive and hence learning was accurate. The decision tree that was cretaed looked like the following :
